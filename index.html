            <h2>🧪 Scientific Passion</h2>
            <p>My scientific inclination fuels my keen interest in creating well-documented projects, where I can discover new things and solve problems. I've dedicated several years of my life to topics such as machine learning, AI, and data visualization. In 2023, I published my first children's book, "A Universe Within You" (Um Universo em Você) aiming to demystify the idea of genius and what it means to be a scientist, emphasizing the common ground between scientists and children.</p>
            <p>I promise I'll not make a joke about being a rocket scientist. Feel free to reach out!✨</p>
